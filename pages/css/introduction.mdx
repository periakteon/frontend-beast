# CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

**CSS** (_Cascading Style Sheets_) is an integral part of web development that focuses on the **presentation** and **styling** of [**HTML**](/html) elements within a web page. It allows developers to apply visual design and layout properties to enhance the aesthetics and user experience of websites.

## Role of CSS in Web Development

**CSS** plays a crucial role in shaping the appearance and layout of web pages:

### Styling HTML Elements

**CSS** enables developers to control the visual aspects of HTML elements, including:

- Text formatting (_font_, _size_, _color_)
- Box model properties (_padding_, _margin_, _border_)
- Background styles (_color_, _image_)
- Positioning and layout (_float_, _flexbox_, _grid_)

### Responsive Design

**CSS** allows for the creation of responsive web designs by using media queries and flexible units, ensuring that websites adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

### Consistency and Branding

By defining consistent styles across a website, **CSS** ensures a unified branding experience, enhancing recognition and user trust.

### Animation and Transitions

**CSS** facilitates the creation of animations and transitions, adding interactivity and engagement to user interactions and page elements.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

Similar to [**HTML**](/html), well-structured **CSS** promotes consistent rendering across different browsers and devices, delivering a uniform experience.

## Applying CSS Styles

**CSS** styles can be applied in multiple ways:

### Inline Styles

Inline styles are directly added to individual [**HTML**](/html) elements using the `style` attribute, providing element-specific styling.

### Internal Stylesheet

An internal stylesheet is defined within the `<style>` tag in the [**HTML**](/html) `<head>`. It applies styles to the entire document.

### External Stylesheet

An external stylesheet is a separate `.css` file linked to the [**HTML**](/html) document using the `<link>` tag. This approach promotes reusability and separation of concerns.

### CSS Selectors

Selectors target specific [**HTML**](/html) elements to apply styles. Some common selectors include:

- Element selector (`element`)
- Class selector (`.classname`)
- ID selector (`#idname`)
- Attribute selector (`[attribute]`)

## Evolution of CSS

<Steps>

### CSS1 (1996)

The initial version introduced basic styling capabilities, focusing on _fonts_, _colors_, and _text layout_.

### CSS2 (1998)

CSS2 expanded styling options to include _positioning_, _backgrounds_, and _borders_. It introduced _media types for print and screen_.

### CSS3 (2001)

CSS3 brought advanced features like _rounded corners_, _gradients_, and _shadows_. It also introduced _media queries for responsive design_.

### CSS4 (Work in Progress)

CSS4 continues the evolution of CSS with _additional features_, _improvements_, and _enhanced browser support_.

</Steps>

Understanding the evolution of **CSS** reveals its transformation from basic styling to a powerful tool for creating visually appealing and interactive web experiences.
