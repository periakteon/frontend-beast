# HTML Element: `<a>`

The `<a>` element is used to create **hyperlinks**. It is also known as **the anchor element**. Hyperlinks are used to navigate between web pages, and to download files, and to send emails. So, they are clickable elements that allow users to navigate to different web pages, resources, or locations on the internet. Here's a detailed explanation of the `<a>` element along with examples for each use case.

## Creating a Basic Link

The most common use of the `<a>` element is to create a basic hyperlink to another web page. You specify the target URL using the `href` attribute.

```html
<a href="https://frontendbeast.com">Frontend Beast</a>
```

In this example, the text "Frontend Beast" is the link text, and the URL "https://frontendbeast.com" is the target URL. When a user clicks on the link, the browser will navigate to the target URL.

## Linking to Email Addresses

You can also use the `<a>` element to create a link to an email address. You can do this by specifying the email address in the `href` attribute, and prefixing it with `mailto:`.

```html
<a href="mailto:contact@example.com">Send an Email</a>
```

In the example above, clicking this link will open the user's email client with "contact@example.com" pre-filled in the recipient field.

## Linking to Phone Numbers

Similarly, you can create links that initiate phone calls on mobile devices with the `tel` attribute.

```html
<a href="tel:+1234567890">Call Us</a>
```

Clicking this link on a mobile device will prompt the user to make a call to the specified phone number.

## Linking to Files

You can also use the `<a>` element to create links to files. You can do this by specifying the file path in the `href` attribute. So, you can link to local files on the user's device using relative or absolute file paths.

```html
<a href="documents/sample.pdf">Download PDF</a>
```

This link would allow users to download a PDF file named `sample.pdf` located in a `documents` directory relative to the web page.

## Anchor Links (Internal Links)

You can also use the `<a>` element to create links to different sections of the same web page. These are also known as **anchor links** or **internal links**. You can do this by specifying the `id` attribute on the target element, and then using the `href` attribute to link to it. This is useful for creating table of contents or navigating to specific sections on a long page.

```html
<a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
```

To use this, you'd need to have an element with the `id` attribute set to `section2` elsewhere on the page:

```html
<h2 id="section2">Section 2</h2>
```

Clicking the link will scroll the page to the `Section 2` content.

## Linking to External Resources (e.g., Images)

You can also use the `<a>` element to create links to external resources such as images. You can do this by specifying the URL of the resource in the `href` attribute. This is useful for creating image galleries or linking to external resources.

```html
<a href="https://frontendbeast.com/images/favicon/android-chrome-512x512.png"
  >View Logo</a
>
```

This link would open the image in the browser when clicked.

## Adding Titles and Accessibility

You can add a title to the link using the `title` attribute. This is useful for providing additional information about the link to users. For example, you can use this to provide a description of the link, or to provide a warning about the link. It's a good practice to include a title attribute to provide additional information about the link, which can help with accessibility and SEO.

```html
<a
  href="https://frontendbeast.com"
  title="Frontend Beast - Learn Web Development"
  >Frontend Beast</a
>
```

Including a title attribute enhances the user experience, especially for screen readers.

## Targeting Links

By default, when a user clicks on a link, the browser will navigate to the target URL in the same tab. You can change this behavior by using the `target` attribute. This attribute allows you to specify where the target URL should be opened. You can use the following values for the `target` attribute:

### `_self`

Opens the target URL in the same tab.

```html
<a href="https://frontendbeast.com" target="_self">Frontend Beast</a>
```

In this example, the target URL will be opened in the same tab when the user clicks on the link.

### `_blank`

Opens the target URL in a new tab.

```html
<a href="https://frontendbeast.com" target="_blank">Frontend Beast</a>
```

In this example, the target URL will be opened in a new tab when the user clicks on the link.

### `_parent`

Opens the target URL in the parent frame.

```html
<a href="https://frontendbeast.com" target="_parent">Frontend Beast</a>
```

In this example, the target URL will be opened in the parent frame when the user clicks on the link.

### `_top`

Opens the target URL in the full body of the window.

```html
<a href="https://frontendbeast.com" target="_top">Frontend Beast</a>
```

In this example, the target URL will be opened in the full body of the window when the user clicks on the link.

    These are the primary use cases for the `<a>` element in HTML. The `href` attribute is the key attribute that determines where the link points to, and you can customize the behavior and appearance of links further using [**CSS**](/css) and JavaScript if needed.

## Playground

You can use the following interactive playground to experiment with the `<a>` element and try out different use cases.
