# Element: `<br>`

The `<br>` element, also known as the **line break** element, is used to insert a line break within text or content.

## Syntax

Its syntax is straightforward and consists of a single, **self-closing** tag:

```html
<br />
```

## Attributes

The `<br>` element has no required attributes, but it does support a few optional attributes for additional control:

### `clear`

The `clear` attribute specifies how the line break should behave in relation to floating elements. It accepts one of the following values:

- `left`: The line break will clear all floating elements to the left.
- `right`: The line break will clear all floating elements to the right.
- `all`: The line break will clear all floating elements to the left and right.

## Examples

### Basic Example

```html {2}
<p>
  This is a <br />
  line break.
</p>
```

**Output:**

export const BasicExample = () => {
  return (
    <p>
      This is a <br /> line break.
    </p>
  );
};

### Clearing Floating Elements

```html {1}
This is some text that clears to the left.<br clear="left" />
This is text that wraps around the line break.
```

**Output:**

export const ClearingFloatingElements = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        This is some text that clears to the left.
        <br clear="left" />
        This is text that wraps around the line break.
      </p>
    </>
  );
};

## Best Practices

To ensure clean and maintainable HTML code, it's essential to follow best practices when using the `<br>` element:

- **Use `<br>` sparingly:** Avoid excessive use of line breaks; instead, structure your content with appropriate HTML elements like _paragraphs_ and _headings_.
- **Favor [CSS](/css) for layout:** Use CSS for controlling spacing and layout whenever possible rather than relying on line breaks for formatting.

## Advanced Features

While `<br>` is a simple element, it can be creatively used in more advanced scenarios:

### Custom Line Spacing

You can use CSS in conjunction with `<br>` to achieve custom line spacing for text.

```html {2}
<p>This is some text.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2em;">This text has increased line spacing.<br /></p>
<p>Back to normal spacing.</p>
```

**Output:**

export const CustomLineSpacing = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>This is some text.</p>
      <p style={{ lineHeight: "2em" }}>
        This text has increased line spacing.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Back to normal spacing.</p>
    </>
  );
};

<CustomLineSpacing />

### Hidden Line Breaks

You can use [**CSS**](/css) to hide line breaks in specific situations or screen sizes, providing responsive design.

```html filename="index.html" {2}
<p>This is some text.</p>
<p class="hide-line-break">This text will wrap without a line break.<br /></p>
<p>Normal flow.</p>
```

```css filename="styles.css"
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .hide-line-break {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

**Output:**

export const HiddenLineBreaks = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>This is some text.</p>
      <p className="hide-line-break">
        This text will wrap without a line break.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>Normal flow.</p>
    </>
  );
};

<HiddenLineBreaks />

Remember to use advanced usages judiciously and maintain accessibility and readability in your HTML code.

In summary, the `<br>` element is a simple yet useful tool for introducing line breaks in HTML content. While it has limited attributes and straightforward syntax, it should be used thoughtfully and sparingly, with [**CSS**](/css) often being a more powerful tool for controlling layout and spacing.

## Playground

<Sandpack
  template="static"
  theme={useDarkTheme() ? atomDark : undefined}
  files={{
    "/index.html": `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>HTML Element: <br></title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
    <body>
      <p>This is a <br> line break.</p>
    </body>
</html>`,
  }}
/>
